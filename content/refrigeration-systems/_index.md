# Refrigeration Systems

Comprehensive coverage of refrigeration cycles, components, refrigerants, and applications spanning food preservation, cold storage, commercial refrigeration, and industrial processes. Refrigeration systems remove heat from low-temperature spaces and reject it to higher-temperature sinks through thermodynamic cycles.

## Fundamental Cycles

### Vapor Compression Refrigeration

The dominant refrigeration technology for commercial and industrial applications. Mechanical compression raises refrigerant pressure and temperature, enabling heat rejection at ambient conditions.

**Key topics:**
- **Cycle Analysis:** P-h diagrams, COP calculations, thermodynamic processes
- **Superheat and Subcooling:** Optimizing refrigeration effect
- **Multi-Stage Compression:** Low-temperature applications
- **Cascade Systems:** Ultra-low temperature refrigeration

**Related Technical Guides:**
- [Vapor Compression Refrigeration Cycle](/technical-guides/vapor-compression-refrigeration/)
- [Refrigeration Cycle Design](/technical-guides/refrigeration-cycle-design/)

### Alternative Cycles

Non-vapor compression technologies for specific applications where electricity or mechanical drive is unavailable or inefficient.

**Technologies:**
- **Absorption Refrigeration:** Waste heat or gas-fired systems
- **Adsorption Refrigeration:** Solar cooling applications
- **Gas Cycle (Air Cycle):** Aircraft environmental control
- **Magnetic Refrigeration:** Emerging technology
- **Thermoelectric:** Small-scale cooling
- **Stirling Cycle:** Research applications

## Refrigerants

### Classification and Properties

Refrigerant selection impacts performance, safety, environmental compliance, and operating costs. Modern refrigerants balance thermodynamic properties with low global warming potential (GWP) and zero ozone depletion potential (ODP).

**Refrigerant families:**
- **CFCs (R-11, R-12):** Banned (high ODP)
- **HCFCs (R-22):** Phase-out complete (ODP > 0)
- **HFCs (R-134a, R-404A, R-410A):** Current standard (GWP restrictions)
- **HFOs (R-1234yf, R-1234ze):** Low-GWP future refrigerants
- **Natural Refrigerants (R-717, R-744, R-290):** Zero GWP alternatives

### Environmental Regulations

- **Montreal Protocol:** ODP phase-out
- **Kigali Amendment:** GWP phase-down schedule
- **EPA SNAP Program:** Application-specific restrictions
- **EU F-Gas Regulation:** HFC quota system

## System Components

### Compressors

Compressors raise refrigerant pressure and temperature, driving the refrigeration cycle. Compressor type selection depends on capacity, refrigerant, and application.

**Types:**
- **Reciprocating:** 1-200 hp, wide capacity range

### Food Processing and Storage

Temperature control preserves food quality, prevents spoilage, and ensures food safety.

**Temperature ranges:**
- **Refrigerated storage:** 32-50°F (fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat)
- **Frozen storage:** -10 to +10°F (frozen foods, ice cream)
- **Blast freezing:** -40 to -20°F (rapid freezing)
- **Ultra-low temperature:** -40 to -100°F (seafood, specialty products)

**Commodity-specific requirements:**
- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Controlled atmosphere, ethylene control
- **Meat and Poultry:** Aging, chill/freeze cycles, humidity control
- **Dairy:** Pasteurization, aging (cheese), ice cream hardening
- **Seafood:** Brine freezing, plate freezing, glazing
