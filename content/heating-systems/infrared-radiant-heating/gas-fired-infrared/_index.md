# Gas-Fired Infrared Systems

Gas-fired infrared heaters convert natural gas or propane combustion energy directly into radiant heat through high-temperature radiating surfaces. These systems achieve radiant fractions of 40-70% compared to 10-20% for conventional furnaces, delivering superior performance in high-ceiling facilities, high-infiltration spaces, and outdoor applications. Gas infrared systems divide into two fundamental categories based on burner surface temperature: high-intensity (luminous) and low-intensity (tube) heaters.

## Combustion-to-Radiation Conversion

### Energy Balance

Total heat input from fuel combustion distributes among multiple pathways:

$$Q_{input} = Q_{radiant} + Q_{convective} + Q_{flue} + Q_{loss}$$

**Radiant fraction:** Proportion of input energy emitted as infrared radiation:

$$f_{rad} = \frac{Q_{radiant}}{Q_{input}}$$

High-intensity heaters achieve $f_{rad}$ = 0.60-0.70 through direct combustion at radiating surface. Low-intensity systems achieve $f_{rad}$ = 0.40-0.55 due to heat exchanger losses and lower surface temperatures.

### Temperature-Radiant Power Relationship

Stefan-Boltzmann law governs radiant emission:

$$Q_{radiant} = \varepsilon \sigma A T^4$$

Doubling burner surface temperature from 700 K to 1400 K increases radiant power by 16× per unit area, explaining the dramatic performance difference between high-intensity and low-intensity systems.

**Practical implications:**
- High-intensity (1800°F): Compact size, high mounting, spot heating
- Low-intensity (800°F): Larger area, uniform distribution, moderate mounting

## System Categories

### High-Intensity (Luminous) Infrared Heaters

**Operating characteristics:**
- Burner surface temperature: 1400-1800°F (760-980°C)

## Burner Design and Combustion

### Premix Combustion Systems

Gas and air mix before combustion (most infrared heaters):

$$\phi = \frac{(F/A)_{actual}}{(F/A)_{stoichiometric}}$$

Where $\phi$ = equivalence ratio

**Design targets:**
- $\phi$ = 0.95-1.00 (slightly lean to stoichiometric)
- Uniform gas-air distribution prevents flashback/liftoff
- Combustion stabilization at high-temperature surface

### Burner Matrix Materials

- Operating limit: 2000-2200°F

**Metal materials:**
- Stainless steel 304/316: Common for fiber burners
- Inconel alloys: Superior oxidation resistance
- FeCrAl alloys: Balance of cost and performance
- Operating limit: 1800-2000°F

**Degradation mechanisms:**

- Expected life: 7-12 years with proper maintenance

## Radiant Tube Heat Exchangers

### Heat Transfer Analysis

Burner heat release transfers to tube wall through convection and radiation:

$$\frac{1}{U} = \frac{1}{h_{gas}} + \frac{t_{wall}}{k_{wall}} + \frac{1}{h_{outside}}$$

Where:
- $h_{gas}$ = Combined convective and radiant heat transfer inside tube (25-50 Btu/h·ft²·°F)
- $t_{wall}$ = Tube wall thickness (typically 0.040-0.080 in)
- $k_{wall}$ = Thermal conductivity (8-10 Btu/h·ft·°F for aluminized steel)
- $h_{outside}$ = External convection and radiation (3-6 Btu/h·ft²·°F)

**Temperature drop:** Gas stream enters tube at 1800-2000°F, exits at 600-800°F. Tube surface averages 700-900°F.

### Tube Materials

**Aluminized steel:**
- Type 1 (aluminum-silicon coating): 1250°F continuous use
- Type 2 (pure aluminum coating): 1100°F continuous use
- Cost-effective for low-to-medium intensity
- Typical life: 15-20 years

**Stainless steel:**
- 409 stainless: Economy grade, 1400°F maximum
- 430 stainless: Better oxidation resistance
- 304/316 stainless: Premium applications, high-intensity zones
- Typical life: 20-30 years

### U-Tube Configuration

**Vacuum (negative pressure) operation:**
- Induced draft fan pulls combustion products through tube
- Burner located at tube entrance
- Negative pressure prevents leakage into space
- Required for unvented applications
- Draft: -0.05 to -0.15 in w.c.

**Advantages:**
- No combustion products in occupied space (if unvented)
- Lower tube wall temperature (longer life)
- Quiet operation

**Disadvantages:**
- Induced draft fan wear and maintenance
- Limited to shorter tube runs (40-60 ft)

### Straight Tube Configuration

**Positive pressure operation:**
- Burner blower pushes products through tube
- Higher pressure allows longer runs
- Typically vented to outdoors
- Pressure: +0.10 to +0.25 in w.c.

**Advantages:**
- Simple construction, fewer components
- Longer tube runs possible (60-100 ft)
- Lower maintenance (no induced draft fan)

**Disadvantages:**
- Must be vented (combustion products under pressure)
- Slightly higher tube temperature
- Potential leak concerns at connections

## Reflector Systems

Reflectors redirect otherwise wasted upward radiation toward occupied zone:

$$\eta_{system} = \eta_{heater} \times (1 + R_{eff})$$

Where:
- $\eta_{heater}$ = Heater combustion efficiency (75-85%)
- $R_{eff}$ = Effective reflector gain (0.40-0.70)

**Typical improvement:** Reflectors increase effective radiant output by 40-70%, equivalent to adding 40-70% more heaters without reflectors.

### Reflector Geometry

**High-intensity heaters:**
- Parabolic reflectors for focused beam
- Focus point 12-18 in below reflector
- Beam angle: 60-90°
- Reflector area: 2-4× burner area

**Low-intensity tube heaters:**
- Semi-cylindrical or "V" shaped reflectors
- Positioned 2-6 in above tube
- Continuous along tube length
- Reflector width: 18-30 in for 4 in tube

### Material Selection

**Polished aluminum (most common):**
- Reflectivity: 85-92% in infrared spectrum
- Anodized surface resists oxidation
- Moderate cost
- Periodic cleaning maintains performance

**Stainless steel:**
- Reflectivity: 70-80%
- Excellent durability in harsh environments
- Higher cost
- Lower maintenance

**Painted steel (economy):**
- Reflectivity: 60-70%
- Requires high-temperature paint
- Lower cost, higher degradation
- Not recommended for premium applications

## Venting and Air Supply

### Vented Systems

All high-intensity and some low-intensity heaters require venting:

**Vent sizing:**
$$A_{vent} = \frac{Q_{input}}{D \times V}$$

Where:
- $A_{vent}$ = Vent area (in²)
- $Q_{input}$ = Input rate (Btu/h)
- $D$ = Draft factor (typically 0.02-0.04 in w.c./ft)
- $V$ = Velocity limit (1500-2500 fpm)

**Vent materials:**
- Category I (draft hood): Type B vent
- Category III (forced draft): AL29-4C stainless
- Category IV (condensing): AL29-4C or PVC (per manufacturer)

### Unvented Low-Intensity Systems

Some low-intensity tube heaters operate unvented (products of combustion released into space):

**Code requirements (NFPA 54/NFGC):**
1. Maximum input: 400,000 Btu/h total in space
2. Space volume requirement: 20 ft³ per 1000 Btu/h input
3. Combustion air openings: Two openings, each 1 in²/4000 Btu/h
4. CO detection recommended

**Advantages:**
- 95-98% effective efficiency (no flue loss)
- Lower installation cost
- Simplified mechanical system

**Disadvantages:**
- Adds moisture to space (combustion byproduct)
- Potential for CO exposure if improperly maintained
- Not allowed in all jurisdictions
- Unsuitable for tightly sealed buildings

### Combustion Air Requirements

**Natural draft systems:**
$$A_{air} = \frac{Q_{total}}{N \times C}$$

Where:
- $A_{air}$ = Free air opening area (in²)
- $Q_{total}$ = Total input all appliances (Btu/h)
- $N$ = Number of openings (typically 2)
- $C$ = Capacity factor (4000 Btu/h per in² for outdoor air)

**Forced draft systems:** Manufacturer-specified intake sizing, typically direct-piped outdoor air.

## Performance Metrics

### Combustion Efficiency

Steady-state combustion efficiency from flue gas analysis:

$$\eta_c = 100\% - \frac{(T_{flue} - T_{air}) \times K}{CO_2\%}$$

Where $K$ = fuel-specific constant (natural gas: 0.62)

**Typical values:**
- High-intensity vented: 75-82%
- Low-intensity vented: 78-85%
- Low-intensity unvented: 95-98% (no flue loss)

### Radiant Efficiency

Fraction of total heat output emitted as radiation:

$$\eta_{rad} = \frac{Q_{radiant}}{Q_{output}} = \frac{Q_{radiant}}{\eta_c \times Q_{input}}$$

**Measurement:** Radiant heat flux sensors at specified distance, integrated over hemisphere.

**Typical values:**
- High-intensity: 60-70%
- Low-intensity: 40-55%

### Energy Effectiveness

Delivered useful heat to occupied zone:

$$E_{eff} = \eta_c \times \eta_{rad} \times \alpha_{surface} \times (1 - f_{stratification})$$

Where:
- $\alpha_{surface}$ = Surface absorptivity (0.85-0.95 typical)
- $f_{stratification}$ = Fraction lost to stratification (0.10-0.25)

**System comparison:**

| System Type | η_c | η_rad | E_eff |
|-------------|-----|-------|-------|
| High-intensity gas (vented) | 80% | 65% | 60-75% |
| Low-intensity gas (vented) | 82% | 50% | 50-65% |
| Low-intensity gas (unvented) | 97% | 50% | 60-75% |
| Forced-air furnace (high bay) | 80% | 15% | 20-35% |

## Safety Considerations

### Surface Temperature Hazards

**Contact burn risk:**
- High-intensity burner face: 1800°F - severe burn on contact
- Low-intensity tube: 800°F - severe burn on contact
- Reflector surfaces: 300-600°F - burn hazard
- Guard screens required below 10 ft mounting

### Combustion Product Exposure

**Carbon monoxide:**
- Properly adjusted: < 50 ppm air-free
- Acceptable limit: < 100 ppm air-free
- Symptom threshold: > 400 ppm air-free
- Regular combustion analysis mandatory

### Ignition of Combustibles

**Clearances to combustibles:**
- High-intensity: 36 in minimum (manufacturer specific)
- Low-intensity: 18 in minimum (manufacturer specific)
- Reflector to ceiling: 12-24 in
- Never mount above stored combustible materials

### Earthquake Restraint

In seismic zones (SDC C or higher):

$$F_{seismic} = S_{DS} \times W \times I_p$$

Where:
- $S_{DS}$ = Design spectral acceleration
- $W$ = Equipment weight
- $I_p$ = Component importance factor (1.0-1.5)

Suspension systems require lateral and longitudinal bracing per ASCE 7.

## Installation Best Practices

### Mounting and Support

**Suspension systems:**
- Rigid pipe/rod hangers for high-intensity (minimize swing)
- Cable/chain acceptable for low-intensity (limited swing)
- Support spacing: 8-12 ft for tube heaters
- Hanger size based on weight plus seismic loads

**Roof/structure penetrations:**
- Maintain clearance per code (typically 18 in to combustibles)
- Firestopping around penetrations
- Weatherproof jack for outdoor exposure
- Thermal expansion consideration for long tube runs

### Gas Piping

**Sizing:** NFPA 54 longest length method or pressure drop calculation:

$$\Delta P = \frac{0.0001306 \times Q^{1.82} \times L}{C^{1.82} \times D^{4.82}}$$

Where:
- $\Delta P$ = Pressure drop (in w.c.)
- $Q$ = Flow rate (ft³/h)
- $L$ = Length (ft)
- $C$ = Factor for specific gravity
- $D$ = Inside diameter (in)

**Typical practice:** Size for < 0.5 in w.c. drop at maximum firing rate.

### Controls Integration

**Minimum control components:**
1. Manual gas valve (shutoff)
2. Automatic gas valve (two-stage redundancy preferred)
3. Ignition system (electronic or standing pilot)
4. Flame safeguard (flame rod or thermocouple)
5. Temperature limit control (high-temperature shutoff)
6. Low-voltage thermostat circuit

**Advanced controls:**
- Modulating gas valve for capacity control
- Outdoor reset for automatic setpoint adjustment
- Occupancy sensors for unoccupied setback
- Building automation system integration
- Remote monitoring and diagnostics
