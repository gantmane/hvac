# Air Conditioning System Selection for HVAC Engineers

AC system selection impacts comfort delivery, energy consumption, maintenance requirements, and life cycle costs. No single system suits all applications; selection depends on building type, load characteristics, and owner priorities.

## System Types Overview

### Direct Expansion (DX) Systems

**Characteristics:**
- Refrigerant directly cools air
- Packaged or split configurations  
- Capacities: 2-150 tons per unit

**Advantages:**
- Lower first cost
- Simple installation
- Fast response
- No water piping/treatment

**Disadvantages:**
- Less energy efficient
- Limited capacity modulation (most systems)
- Refrigerant line length limits (typically < 150 ft)

**Applications:** Small commercial, retail, light industrial

### Chilled Water Systems

**Characteristics:**
- Central chiller produces 40-45°F water
- Distributed to air handlers/fan coils
- Capacities: 50-10,000+ tons central plant

**Advantages:**
- Highest efficiency (especially part-load)
- Unlimited piping runs
- Central equipment (easier maintenance)
- Thermal storage potential
- Free cooling capability

**Disadvantages:**
- High first cost
- Complex controls
- Water treatment required
- Freeze protection needed

**Applications:** Large commercial, hospitals, universities, high-rise

### Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF)

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple indoor units on common refrigerant circuit
- Capacities: 6-60 tons per outdoor unit
- Simultaneous heating and cooling (heat recovery models)

**Advantages:**
- High efficiency (especially part-load)
- Zone-level control
- Simultaneous heating/cooling
- Compact indoor units

**Disadvantages:**
- High first cost
- Refrigerant line length limits (500-1,000 ft)
- Complex controls/troubleshooting
- Limited outdoor air integration

**Applications:** Medium commercial, hospitality, multi-tenant residential

## Selection Criteria Matrix

| Criteria | DX | Chilled Water | VRF |
|----------|----|--------------|----|
| First Cost | $ | $$$ | $$ |
| Energy Efficiency | Fair | Excellent | Very Good |
| Maintenance | Distributed | Centralized | Distributed |
| Control Flexibility | Limited | Excellent | Excellent |
| Zoning Capability | Fair | Excellent | Excellent |
| Outdoor Air Handling | Direct | Excellent | Limited |
| Refrigerant Charge | Low | None | High |

## Energy Analysis Example

**100-ton office building annual cooling energy:**

- **DX rooftop units (10 EER):** 1,200,000 kWh/year
- **VRF system (15 EER avg):** 800,000 kWh/year  
- **Chilled water (17 EER avg):** 700,000 kWh/year

At $0.12/kWh:
- DX: $144,000/year
- VRF: $96,000/year  
- Chilled water: $84,000/year

## Life Cycle Cost Considerations

**First Cost (typical, $/ton):**
- DX: $3,000-$5,000
- VRF: $5,000-$7,000
- Chilled water: $6,000-$10,000

**Maintenance ($/ton-year):**
- DX: $200-$300
- VRF: $250-$350
- Chilled water: $150-$250

**Equipment Life:**
- DX: 15-20 years
- VRF: 20-25 years
- Chilled water: 20-30 years (chillers), 15-25 years (AHUs)

## Practical Applications

1. **< 50 tons:** DX or VRF
2. **50-200 tons:** VRF or chilled water (depends on zoning needs)
3. **> 200 tons:** Chilled water
4. **Renovation:** VRF (minimal shaft/pipe modifications)
5. **Mission critical:** Chilled water (redundancy, reliability)
