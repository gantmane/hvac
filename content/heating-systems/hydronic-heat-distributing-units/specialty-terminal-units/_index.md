# Specialty Terminal Units

Specialty hydronic terminal units provide space heating in architecturally constrained applications where conventional baseboard, radiators, or convectors cannot be installed due to dimensional limitations, aesthetic requirements, or functional constraints. These compact forced-convection or natural-convection devices integrate into building elements (under cabinets, in floor trenches, behind architectural features) while maintaining adequate heat output (3,000-15,000 Btu/h per unit) through enhanced fin surface, optimized airflow patterns, or strategic placement to address local heat loss effectively.

## Kickspace Heaters (Under-Cabinet)

### Design and Construction

**Configuration:**
- Compact fan-forced heater: 3-6 in high, 9-15 in deep, 10-30 in wide
- Finned-tube hot water coil with tangential or centrifugal blower
- Toe-space installation: Beneath kitchen cabinets, vanities, built-ins
- Front grille discharge: Horizontal air delivery into room

**Heat exchanger:**
- Copper tube, aluminum fins
- Fin density: 10-14 fins per inch
- 1-2 coil rows deep
- Compact coil face area (60-200 in²)

**Fan:**
- Tangential (cross-flow) blower most common
- Low profile to fit 3-4 in height
- Airflow: 80-200 CFM
- Quiet operation (critical for residential applications)

**Enclosure:**
- Sheet metal cabinet with mounting flanges
- Removable front grille
- Integrated thermostat or remote sensor
- Optional built-in control valve

### Performance Characteristics

**Heat output:**
- Small (12-18 in wide): 3,000-6,000 Btu/h @ 180°F water
- Medium (18-24 in wide): 6,000-9,000 Btu/h
- Large (24-30 in wide): 9,000-12,000 Btu/h

**Water temperature dependency:**

$$Q \propto (T_w - T_a)$$

Approximately linear for forced convection over typical range.

| Water Temp | Entering Air 65°F | Output (% of 180°F rating) |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 200°F | 65°F | 115% |
| 180°F | 65°F | 100% (rated) |
| 160°F | 65°F | 85% |
| 140°F | 65°F | 70% |

**Airflow pattern:**
- Horizontal discharge parallel to floor
- Throw: 6-12 ft depending on fan speed
- Spreads along floor, rises via natural convection
- Effective for localized heat delivery

### Installation and Application

**Mounting:**
- Rough-in during cabinet installation (new construction) or retrofit
- Support from floor or wall mounting brackets
- Align with toe-kick recess (typically 3-4 in high, 3 in deep)
- Electrical and plumbing concealed behind cabinet

**Piping connections:**
- 1/2 in supply and return (typical)
- Isolation valves accessible for service
- Air vent at coil high point
- Flexible connectors accommodate cabinet removal

**Electrical:**
- 120V or 24V fan motor
- Integral thermostat or remote wall sensor
- Line voltage or low voltage control

**Applications:**
- **Kitchens:** Primary or supplemental heat where wall space occupied by cabinets
- **Bathrooms:** Vanity toe-kick heating, fast warm-up
- **Entryways:** Built-in benches or cabinetry with integrated heating
- **Offices:** Under desk/credenza heating without visible terminals

**Advantages:**
- Invisible (no wall space consumption)
- Fast response (forced convection, low thermal mass)
- Effective local heating (at floor level where people stand)

**Limitations:**
- Requires cabinet installation (not suitable for open walls)
- Fan noise (though quieter models available)
- Filter maintenance access (remove grille)
- Electrical power required

## Trench Heaters (In-Floor Perimeter)

### Design and Construction

**Configuration:**
- Linear finned-tube convector recessed in floor trench
- Installed along perimeter (typically beneath curtain walls, glazing)
- Grated top cover: Flush with finished floor
- Natural convection or fan-assisted

**Trench construction:**
- Depth: 6-12 in below finished floor
- Width: 4-10 in
- Length: Continuous runs 10-50+ ft
- Waterproof liner (prevent groundwater intrusion)
- Insulation beneath and sides (minimize heat loss to ground)

**Heat exchanger element:**
- Copper tube, aluminum fins
- Fin density: 8-12 fpi (natural convection), 10-14 fpi (fan-assisted)
- 1-3 coil rows depending on output requirements

**Cover grating:**
- Aluminum, steel, or bronze finish
- Slot or perforated pattern (40-60% free area)
- Removable sections for maintenance access
- Load rating: Adequate for foot traffic (light-duty) or vehicle traffic (heavy-duty)

### Performance Characteristics

**Heat output (natural convection):**
- Low output: 150-300 Btu/h per linear foot @ 180°F water
- Medium output: 300-500 Btu/h per linear foot
- High output: 500-800 Btu/h per linear foot

**Heat output (fan-assisted):**
- Medium output: 500-800 Btu/h per linear foot
- High output: 800-1,200 Btu/h per linear foot
- Very high output: 1,200-2,000 Btu/h per linear foot

Fan-assisted units achieve 1.5-3× output of natural convection in same physical size.

**Temperature correction:**

$$Q_{actual} = Q_{rated} \left(\frac{T_{w,actual} - T_a}{T_{w,rated} - T_a}\right)^{1.3}$$

Natural convection follows similar correction as baseboard/radiators.

### Installation and Application

**Installation procedure:**
1. Form or install trench liner during floor construction
2. Install insulation (prevent downward heat loss)
3. Install element with piping connections
4. Test for leaks before closing floor
5. Install grating after floor finish complete

**Piping:**
- Supply and return connections at trench ends or intervals
- Isolation valves accessible in adjacent spaces
- Air vents at high points (typically at connections)
- Pitch for drainage if required

**Applications:**
- **Curtain wall perimeters:** Counteract cold downdraft from glazing
- **Atriums and lobbies:** Invisible heating for architectural spaces
- **Swimming pool decks:** Perimeter heating, condensation control
- **Retail storefronts:** Floor-level heating without obstructing displays

**Advantages:**
- Completely invisible (floor-flush installation)
- Excellent coverage along perimeter
- No wall space required
- Effective at addressing curtain wall heat loss

**Limitations:**
- Expensive installation (floor integration)
- Limited to new construction or major renovation
- Maintenance access requires grating removal
- Potential for moisture intrusion if not properly sealed

## Toe-Kick Heaters (Low-Profile)

### Design Variants

Toe-kick heaters encompass both **kickspace heaters** (fan-forced, under-cabinet) and **low-profile natural convection** units installed at floor level.

**Low-profile natural convection toe-kick:**
- Height: 2-4 in
- Finned-tube element with front grille
- No fan (natural convection only)
- Quiet operation, no electrical
- Lower output than fan-forced: 200-500 Btu/h per linear foot

**Installation:**
- Along wall base (replace baseboard)
- Beneath low sills (window seats)
- Recessed in wall cavity at floor level

**Output comparison:**

| Unit Type | Output per Linear Foot | Fan Required | Electrical |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Natural convection toe-kick | 200-500 Btu/h | No | No |
| Fan-forced kickspace (per unit) | 3,000-12,000 Btu/h | Yes | Yes |
| Standard baseboard | 400-800 Btu/h | No | No |

### Applications

**Natural convection toe-kick:**
- Residential bathrooms (supplement)
- Low-sill applications (8-12 in sill height)
- Quiet environments (bedrooms)
- Locations without electrical access

**Fan-forced kickspace:**
- Higher output requirements

- Applications: Office buildings, schools, healthcare

## Sizing and Selection Considerations

### Load Matching

**Determine heat loss:**
- Calculate local heat loss where specialty unit installed
- Consider specific loss mechanisms (window transmission, infiltration at doors)

**Select unit type:**
- Based on installation constraints (space, aesthetics, noise tolerance)
- Match output capability to load

**Verify capacity:**

$$Q_{required} \leq Q_{unit} \times CF_{temp} \times F_{safety}$$

Where $F_{safety}$ = 1.1-1.15.

### Example Selection

**Kitchen perimeter wall:**
- Heat loss: 4,500 Btu/h
- Cabinet run: 10 ft with 3 cabinet sections
- Water temperature: 160°F average

**Options:**
1. Three kickspace heaters (one per cabinet): 3 × 5,000 Btu/h @ 180°F = 15,000 Btu/h rated
   - @ 160°F: 15,000 × 0.85 = 12,750 Btu/h ✓ (adequate, though oversized)
   - Advantage: Distributed heating, fast response
   - Disadvantage: Three fan units (cost, maintenance, noise)

2. Trench heater: 10 ft × 500 Btu/h·ft @ 180°F = 5,000 Btu/h rated
   - @ 160°F: 5,000 × 0.75 = 3,750 Btu/h (inadequate)
   - Would require high-output trench (800 Btu/h·ft rated)
   - Advantage: Invisible, quiet (natural convection)
   - Disadvantage: Expensive installation, floor integration

3. Two kickspace heaters: 2 × 6,000 Btu/h @ 180°F = 12,000 Btu/h
   - @ 160°F: 12,000 × 0.85 = 10,200 Btu/h ✓
   - Compromise: Adequate output, fewer units, lower cost than option 1

## Control and Integration

### Individual Unit Control

**Kickspace heaters:**
- Integral thermostat (mechanical or electronic)
- Remote wall sensor with relay
- Line voltage or low voltage control
- Fan cycles with heating demand

**Trench heaters:**
- Zone valve control (multiple trenches on single valve)
- Thermostatic valve for individual control
- Fan control (if fan-assisted): Thermostat or manual switch

### System Integration

**Series or parallel piping:**
- Small units: Series acceptable (limited water volume)
- Multiple units: Parallel preferred (independent control, balanced flow)

**Mixed system:**
- Specialty units on same zones as conventional terminals
- Size piping for combined flow
- Balance for adequate flow to all terminals

## Maintenance Considerations

**Access:**
- Ensure removable grilles, panels, or covers for service
- Plan access during design phase
- Document hidden unit locations

**Filter maintenance (fan units):**
- Monthly inspection during heavy use
- Replace or clean per schedule
- Restricted airflow reduces output 20-40%

**Coil cleaning:**
- Annual vacuuming of fins
- Chemical cleaning if heavily soiled
- Access via grille or panel removal

**Piping:**
- Verify isolation valves accessible
- Bleed air from coils annually
- Drain if freeze risk
