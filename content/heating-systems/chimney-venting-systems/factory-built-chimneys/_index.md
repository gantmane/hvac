- All chimneys require listed clearance to combustibles
- Maintain clearance throughout height

**Enclosed chases:**
- Combustible chase construction permitted
- Maintain listed clearance to all chase surfaces
- Ventilate chase at top and bottom
- Insulate chase in cold climates to reduce exterior condensation

### Penetrations

**Ceiling/floor penetrations:**
- Listed ceiling support box or radiation shield
- Firestop spacer maintains clearance
- Load transfer from chimney to structure

**Roof penetration:**
- Adjustable roof flashing (0/12 to 12/12 pitch)
- Storm collar prevents water entry
- Clearance to roof deck: 2 in. typical

**Attic/concealed space:**
- Radiation shield every 8 ft of concealed run
- Prevents overheating of surrounding materials
- Fire-rated access for inspection

## Structural Support

### Support Requirements

**Maximum unsupported height:** Varies by manufacturer, typically:
- **Roof-mounted:** 5 ft above roof support
- **Wall-mounted:** Support bracket every 6-8 ft
- **Cathedral ceiling:** May require intermediate supports

**Support methods:**

1. **Ceiling support box:**
   - Transfers chimney weight to ceiling joists
   - Maintains clearance to combustibles
   - Encloses chimney at ceiling penetration

2. **Roof support:**
   - Adjustable flashing with support collar
   - For installations starting at roof level
   - Limited height above roof per manufacturer

3. **Wall bands:**
   - Secure chimney to exterior wall
   - Prevent lateral movement from wind
   - Required every 6-8 ft of exposed height

4. **Offset supports:**
   - Special fittings for horizontal runs
   - Transfer weight to wall or structure
   - Limit horizontal run per manufacturer

### Seismic and Wind Considerations

**High-wind areas:**
- Additional wall bands
- Guy wires for very tall installations
- Reduce unsupported height above roof

**Seismic zones:**

- Typical: 3 ft from window or door opening

### Connector Pipes

**Single-wall connector:**
- Connects appliance to chimney base
- Material: 24-gauge galvanized or stainless steel
- Clearance to combustibles: 18 in. (6 in. with shielding)
- Maximum length: 75% of chimney height, or 10 ft maximum
- Slope: ¼ in./ft upward to chimney

**Listed vent connector:**
- Type B vent or special connector
- Reduced clearances per listing
- Used where space constraints prevent single-wall clearance

## Sizing and Performance

### Chimney Diameter Selection

**Match appliance outlet:**
- Most common: Use same diameter as appliance outlet
- Reduces turbulence, improves draft
- Simplifies connection

**Sizing up:**
- Increase one size for very tall chimneys (>30 ft)
- Very cold climate exterior installations
- Increase draft to overcome additional resistance

**Sizing down:**
- Not recommended
- Increases velocity, pressure drop
- May violate manufacturer's requirements

**Common sizes:**
- 5 in., 6 in., 7 in., 8 in., 10 in., 12 in., 14 in., 16 in., 18 in. diameter

### Draft Performance

Factory-built chimneys generally provide better draft than masonry:

**Advantages:**
- Insulation maintains flue gas temperature
- Smooth inner liner (low friction)
- Round cross-section (optimal flow)
- Tight joints (minimal air leakage)

**Performance factors:**
- Exterior installations: Insulation maintains draft in cold weather
- Tall chimneys: Greater natural draft
- Tight construction: Less parasitic air

## Material Compatibility

### Stainless Steel Grades

| Grade | Applications | Corrosion Resistance | Cost |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|------|
| 304 | Gas, some oil | Good | Moderate |
| 316 | Oil, solid fuel | Better | Higher |
| AL29-4C | Condensing gas | Excellent | Highest |
| 444 | High-temp gas | Very good | Moderate-high |

**Selection criteria:**
- Fuel type and sulfur content
- Appliance efficiency (condensing or non-condensing)
- Environment (coastal, industrial)

### Insulation Materials

**Mineral wool:**
- Temperature rating: 2,000°F+
- Non-combustible, won't settle
- Good compressive strength

**Ceramic fiber:**
- Temperature rating: 2,300°F+
- Lightweight, excellent insulation
- Higher cost than mineral wool

**Vermiculite:**
- Expanded mica mineral
- Pourable, fills voids
- Lower temperature rating than wool

## Common Installation Errors

**Mixing brands:**
- Each manufacturer's system is unique
- Components not interchangeable
- Voids listing, creates safety hazard
- **Solution:** Use all components from same manufacturer

**Inadequate support:**
- Exceeding unsupported height
- Chimney weight on appliance
- **Solution:** Follow manufacturer's support requirements exactly

**Clearance violations:**
- Framing, insulation too close to chimney
- Heat damage, fire risk
- **Solution:** Verify clearances before closing walls

**Improper termination:**
- Too short above roof
- Subject to downdrafts
- **Solution:** Apply 3 ft / 2-10 rule

**Horizontal connector too long:**
- Excessive resistance
- Condensation, creosote
- **Solution:** Limit to code maximum (typically 75% of vertical height)

## Advantages vs. Masonry
